# Bread's Cards Remake

This is a remake of my old mod from like a year or two ago that adds a bunch of random cards and 2 classes

### Currently has 76 Cards including hidden ones (25 w/ card art)

(and 1 map)



Also it has some utils inside it:

- Attach a "prop card" to your cards that shows while hovering over the card in the card pick phase

- Set custom guaranteed cards to any slot (its Func<Player, CardInfo> so you can also roll random cards with this and some other stuff)

### THESE UTILS WILL EVENTUALLY BE MOVED INTO A SEPERATE MOD WHERE THEY WILL HAVE BETTER DOCUMENTATION
